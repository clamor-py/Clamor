        Complete a series of checks to see if it could be a snowflake

        The following checks are to ensure that it *could* be a discord ID.
            1. Makes sure it isn't 0 or less
            2. It makes sure the snowflake isn't larger than 64 bits.
            3. It makes sure the snowflake is at least 22 bits.
            4. It makes sure the timestamp isn't less than the discord epoch.
            5. It makes sure the timestamp isn't greater than now

        -------
        bool
            True if the ID could belong to discord, False otherwise.
